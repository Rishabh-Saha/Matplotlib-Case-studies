Types of derived metrics:

    - Type Driven
        - Steven's typology
            - Nominal 
                - Eg: RBG, Male-Female
            - Ordinal 
                - Eg: Education Level, Height
                - Ordinal variables are nominal as well
            - Interval (Mathematical differnce but not multiplication/division)
                - Eg: Celsius, dates 
                - Interval variables are both nominal and ordinal
            - Ratio
                - Eg: Sales in $, Marks
                - Ratio variables are nominal, ordinal and interval type
        - Location based metrics
            - Eg: Continent, Country, State, ...
        - Type Metrics
            - Eg: Web URL: Hostname, Parameters, SSL

    - Business driven
        Deriving metrics from columns require domain knowledge
        - Eg: Cutoff marks in JEE exam, based on this knowledge you can create a column from marks called "Pass/Fail"

    - Data derived 
        Data-driven metrics can be created based on the variables present in the existing data set.
        - Eg:  If you have two variables in your data set such as "weight" and "height" which shows a high correlation. So, instead of analysing "weight" and "height" variables separately, you can think of deriving a new metric "Body Mass Index (BMI)".
