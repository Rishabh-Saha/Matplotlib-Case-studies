Metadata description describes the data in a structured way.
You should make it a habit of creating a metadata description for whatever data set you are working on. Not only will it serve as a reference point for you, it will also help other people understand the data better and save time.

Types of Variables

Categorical
    - Ordered ones have some kind of ordering. Some examples are
        Salary = High-Medium-low
        Month = Jan-Feb-Mar etc.
    - Unordered ones do not have the notion of high-low, more-less etc. Example:
        Type of loan taken by a person = home, personal, auto etc.
        Organisation of a person = Sales, marketing, HR etc.

Quantitative / numeric variables


-------------
How to plot graphs on the type of variables:

Unordered Categorical Variables
    - Rank them based on frequency 
    - Plot a log/log line scale, and you might see "power law" 
Ordered Categorical Variables
    - Plot a histogram to find interesting observations


Quantitative or numeric variables.

    - You can treat it same as Ordered Categorical variables
    - You can get more information out of these variables like mean, mode and quantile information
