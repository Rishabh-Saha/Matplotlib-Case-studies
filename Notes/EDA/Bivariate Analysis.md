On continuous variables
    Find correlation between 2 variables
        Correlation is a number between -1 and 1 which quantifies the extent to which two variables ‘correlate’ with each other.
            - If one increases as the other increases, the correlation is positive
            - If one decreases as the other increases, the correlation is negative
            - If one stays constant as the other varies, the correlation is zero
