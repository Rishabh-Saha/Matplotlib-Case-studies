    "- **Improved accuracy and relevance** of the generated results\n",
    "- **Reduced amount of irrelevant or inaccurate information** presented to the user\n",
    "- **More personalised and informative search results**\n",

    "Traditionally, many methods of re-ranking have been used in search such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), hybrid search methods and cross-encoder models. For this project, we will focus on the popular method of using cross-encoders for our re-ranking task. The image above illustrates the re-ranking component once the search results have been collected by the semantic search layer."
