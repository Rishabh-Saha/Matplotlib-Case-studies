These four levels of the generative AI software stack can be summarised as follows:

- LLMs and APIs: The large language models (LLMs) are the main component in this software stack. It processes the userâ€™s data and provides a response. As LLMs are very expensive to train and host, developers prefer to access them using application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by well-established models, such as GPT-4, Midjourney and so on.

- Vector databases: Vector databases provide a way to unlock a new level of performance by allowing the LLM to access the database semantically. 

- LLM frameworks: LLM frameworks are collections of software tools that allow the developer to leverage other technologies to improve the performance of the LLM. For example, the Langchain framework allows you to use the WolframAlpha API to perform complex mathematical calculations.

- Deploy: These are tools that are used to deploy your application on the internet. As LLM software has some specific requirements, many deployment service providers have started providing end-to-end services specifically for LLM applications.
